# GenuityApi
Machine learning model which detects fraud Banknote.
I created a machine learning model in jupyter notebook. Which was pickled and stored.
* The pickled model is being used by my app to predict model.
* flask is used to create the backend.
* flasgeer  is used to create the UI.
* Heroku is used to deploy the model.
## This model will be deployed on the net
link for the model : https://genuityapi.herokuapp.com/apidocs/
## Heroku limits
Since heroku doesnt allow deployment of more than one project for free, this link might not work in the future. But this repository can be cloned and run in local server.
